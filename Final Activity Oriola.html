	<h2>Java Script simple Math</h2>
	<p id="demo"></p>
	<script>
	let x = 2;
	let y = 5;
	let z = x - y;
	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = z;
	</script>
	<p>Just basic math using Java script, the give n numbers are 2 and 5 which is then subtracted giving us -3. 2-5 = 3</p>

	<h2>What I have learned</h2>
	<p>I learned alot in Web design more than I thought I would when I first came into class. I however feel
	that I could have learned more if I attended the classes consistently as I was absent from most of them due to a
	incident that left me unmotivated and sad for a while. While it is a shame that I wasn't abel to learn much my 
	interest for web design is still here and I might continue to pursue and improve my skills on it. The basics of html were good to go through as 
	I have forgotten or vaguely remember the html language, css was fun to learn and go through, it allowed me to design my websites more properly 
	than before with only html. As Javascript and Webservers I was unfortunately not present during those times as such I don't know much about them.</p>
	<p>I won't be surprised if I have to repeat this subject next term but maybe this time I hope no incident will harm
	my ability to come to classes to relearn the principles and coding of html. Mostly I want to learn more about Javascript, web hoisting and basic principles of web design.
	that is all that I can type as I am sick and want rest.</p>

	<h2>Difficulty in finding a web server</h2>
	<p>I tried to look for a proper and free web hosting site for this page but unfortunately 
	I wasn't able to come across one, I was probably looking for it in the wrongplace so 
	sadly this site won't be hosted.</p>
